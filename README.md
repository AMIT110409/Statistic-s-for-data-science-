# Statistic-s-for-data-science-
Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. Data science is a field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data.

Statistics is an essential tool for data science. It provides the foundation for data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Statistics can be used to:

Describe the data
Identify patterns in the data
Make predictions about the data
Test hypotheses about the data
There are many different statistical techniques that can be used for data science. Some of the most common techniques include:

Descriptive statistics: This is used to describe the data in a way that is easy to understand. Descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the data, identify patterns in the data, and compare different groups of data.
Inferential statistics: This is used to make inferences about the population from which the data was collected. Inferential statistics can be used to test hypotheses, make predictions, and estimate the size of an effect.
Machine learning: This is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to create models that can learn from data. Machine learning models can be used to make predictions, classify data, and cluster data.
Statistics is a complex and ever-evolving field. However, the basic concepts of statistics are essential for data science. If you are interested in a career in data science, then you should have a strong understanding of statistics.

Here are some of the benefits of learning statistics for data science:

Statistics can help you to understand the data that you are working with.
Statistics can help you to identify patterns in the data.
Statistics can help you to make predictions about the data.
Statistics can help you to test hypotheses about the data.
Statistics can help you to make decisions based on the data.
